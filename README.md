### Library Management System

**DATABASE SCHEMA**
"First, I needed to create the authors table where I stored the name and biography. Then, I created the libraries table, where I kept the name and location. For example, I thought of the 4th-grade magazines as the name, while the location would be Üsküdar Central. Finally, I established the books table, where I created relationships by adding author_id and library_id to associate it with the other tables. This way, I completed my database setup."
